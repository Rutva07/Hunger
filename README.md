# About 
This project simulates a modified version of the Hunger Games using Binary Search Trees (BSTs) to manage districts and participants. The game involves creating districts, categorizing people based on their birth months (odd or even), and managing duels between randomly chosen participants from distinct districts. The BST structure efficiently handles adding, searching, and eliminating districts, making the game's operations more time-efficient.
